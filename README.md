## Development environment setup

* [Install Dart for the web](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/sdk#install). The customized Dart version Flutter ships with is not suitable for web development.
* Install [webdev](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/webdev) by running `pub global activate webdev`. This requires that you ran your Dart installation properly and Dart is part of your PATH.
* Install an IDE. You can't go wrong with [WebStorm](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/webstorm). If that doesn't tickle your fancy, [there are other options too](https://www.dartlang.org/tools#ides).
* Install the Dart plugin for your IDE.

Finally, if you haven't already, [install Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
And the Flutter plugin for your IDE.
